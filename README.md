# Wallet App

## Deployment to Shared Hosting

To deploy this application to shared hosting, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd wallet-app
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the application for static deployment:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

3. After the build completes, a folder named `out` will be created containing static files.

4. Upload the entire contents of the `out` folder to your shared hosting using FTP or your hosting provider's file manager.

5. Important Notes:
   - Make sure your hosting supports client-side routing or configure it to redirect all requests to index.html
   - RainbowKit wallet connectivity is configured and will work in the static build
   - No server-side functionality will be available in this deployment
